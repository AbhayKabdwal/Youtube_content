# How to Install Git on Windows

## Step 1: Download the Git Installer
First, you need to download the latest version of Git. You can download it from the official Git website. Here is the link: Git Downloads

## Step 2: Run the Installer
Once the installer is downloaded, run the .exe file. This will start the installation process.

## Step 3: License Agreement
After running the installer, a window will pop up showing the GNU General Public License. Click on 'Next' to agree to the terms and move forward with the installation.

## Step 4: Select Installation Directory
Next, you need to choose where you want to install Git on your machine. By default, it will be installed in your Program Files directory. If you want to change this, click on 'Browse' and select your preferred directory. Once done, click 'Next'.

## Step 5: Select Components
In this window, you can choose which features you want to enable. The default options are usually suitable for most users. Click 'Next' when you're done.

## Step 6: Choose the Default Editor
Here, you can choose the text editor that you want to use with Git. If you're not sure which one to choose, you can stick with the default option (Vim). Click 'Next' once you've made your selection.

## Step 7: Adjusting your PATH Environment
In this step, it's recommended to choose "Git from the command line and also from 3rd-party software". This option ensures that Git can be used from both Git Bash and the Windows Command Prompt.

## Step 8: Choosing HTTPS Transport Backend
The next window will ask you to choose your preferred HTTPS transport backend. The recommended option is "Use the OpenSSL library".

## Step 9: Configuring Line Ending Conversions
Here, it's recommended to choose "Checkout Windows-style, commit Unix-style line endings". This ensures compatibility when working with repositories created on different operating systems.

## Step 10: Configuring Terminal Emulator
In this step, choose "Use MinTTY (the default terminal of MSYS2)".

## Step 11: Configuring Extra Options
In this window, leave all options at their default settings and click 'Next'.

## Step 12: Install
Finally, click 'Install' to begin the installation process. Once it's complete, click 'Finish'. You now have Git installed on your Windows machine!

To verify that Git has been installed correctly, open a new command prompt window and type `git --version`. This should display the version of Git that's been installed.
