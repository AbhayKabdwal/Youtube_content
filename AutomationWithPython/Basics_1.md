# Python Basics

## Variables

- Variables are used to store data in Python.
- You can create a variable and assign a value to it using the assignment operator `=`.

<br>

```py
# Example: Creating and assigning values to variables

name = "John"
age = 30
```


- Variable names should follow certain rules:
    - Must start with a letter (a-z, A-Z) or underscore (_).
    - Can contain letters, numbers, and underscores.
    - Variables are case-sensitive.


```py
# Example: Variable naming

first_name = "Alice"
_last_name = "Smith"
```

## Data Types

Python has various data types to represent different types of values.
Common data types include integers, floating-point numbers, strings, lists, tuples and dictionaries.

<br>

```py
# Example: Data types

age = 25                                     # Integer
height = 5.8                                 # Float
name = "Alice"                               # String
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]       # List
company_executives = ("Mark","Jeff","Steve") # Tuple
students = {1:"Aman",2:"Ramesh",3:"Suresh"}  # Dictionary
```
<br>

# Operators in Python
Operators are special symbols that perform some operations on values or variables. Python supports various types of operators such as:

Arithmetic operators: these operators are used to perform mathematical calculations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, etc. For example:

```py
# Example : Numerical operators in python

x = 10
y = 5

print(x + y) # 15
print(x - y) # 5
print(x * y) # 50
print(x / y) # 2.0
print(x % y) # 0 (remainder of x / y)
print(x ** y) # 100000 (x raised to the power of y)
print(x // y) # 2 (integer division of x / y)
```
<br>

## Comparison operators: 

These operators are used to compare two values or variables and return a boolean value (True or False). For example:

```py
# Example : Comparison operators in python

x = 10
y = 5

print(x == y) # False (x is equal to y)
print(x != y) # True (x is not equal to y)
print(x > y) # True (x is greater than y)
print(x < y) # False (x is less than y)
print(x >= y) # True (x is greater than or equal to y)
print(x <= y) # False (x is less than or equal to y)
```
<br>

## Logical operators: 
These operators are used to combine two or more boolean expressions and return a boolean value. The logical operators in Python are and, or, and not. For example:

```py
# Example : Logical operators in python

x = True
y = False

print(x and y) # False (x and y are both True)
print(x or y) # True (x or y is True)
print(not x) # False (the opposite of x)
```
<br>

## Assignment operators: 

These operators are used to assign a value to a variable. The basic assignment operator is =. There are also some shorthand assignment operators that combine an arithmetic or bitwise operator with an assignment. For example:

```py
# Example : Assignment operators in python

x = 10 # assign 10 to x
x += 5 # equivalent to x = x + 5
x -= 5 # equivalent to x = x - 5
x *= 5 # equivalent to x = x * 5
x /= 5 # equivalent to x = x / 5
x %= 5 # equivalent to x = x % 5
x **= 5 # equivalent to x = x ** 5
x //= 5 # equivalent to x = x // 5
```
<br>

## Bitwise operators: 

These operators are used to perform operations on binary numbers (represented as bits). The bitwise operators in Python are & (bitwise and), | (bitwise or), ^ (bitwise xor), ~ (bitwise not), << (left shift), and >> (right shift). For example:
