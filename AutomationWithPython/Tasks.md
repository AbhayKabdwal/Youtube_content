# Some programs you sould try first

### Task 1: Calculate the Factorial

Write a Python program that takes an integer input `n` and calculates its factorial using a loop. The factorial of a non-negative integer `n` is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to `n`. For example, the factorial of 5 (denoted as 5!) is 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1.

### Task 2: Word Frequency Counter

Write a Python function that takes a text as input (a string) and returns a dictionary containing the frequency of each word in the text. You should tokenize the input text, remove punctuation, and convert all words to lowercase. Make use of regular expressions, string methods, and dictionaries.

### Task 3: Find Prime Numbers

Write a Python program that takes an integer input `n` and prints all prime numbers less than or equal to `n`. Prime numbers are those that are divisible by only 1 and themselves. Implement an efficient algorithm for this task, such as the Sieve of Eratosthenes.
