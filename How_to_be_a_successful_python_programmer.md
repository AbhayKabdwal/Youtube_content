# How to be a successful Python programmer

Python is a powerful and versatile programming language that can help you achieve your goals and dreams. Here are some points that can help you become a successful Python programmer.

## Read the documentation

- The official Python documentation is a great source of information and reference for learning and using Python.
- It covers the basic syntax, built-in types and functions, standard library modules, language features, and best practices.
- It also has tutorials, guides, FAQs, and glossaries that explain various aspects of Python in detail.

- Reading the documentation will help you understand how Python works and what it can do.

## Read Automate the Boring Stuff with Python

- Automate the Boring Stuff with Python is a book by Al Sweigart that teaches you how to use Python to automate various tasks on your computer, such as renaming files, scraping web pages, sending emails, filling out forms, and more.
- The book is aimed at beginners who want to learn Python by doing practical projects.
- You can read the book online for free or buy a print or ebook version.

- The book also has a companion website that provides video lectures, quizzes, practice projects, and additional resources.

## Read more advanced topics

- Once you have mastered the basics of Python, you can explore more advanced topics that will enhance your skills and knowledge.
- Some of the topics that you can read about are:
- Object-oriented programming: This is a paradigm that organizes code into classes and objects that have attributes and methods. It allows you to create reusable and modular code that can model complex systems and behaviors. You can learn more about object-oriented programming in Python from [this tutorial].
- Functional programming: This is a paradigm that emphasizes pure functions that avoid side effects and mutable state. It allows you to write concise and elegant code that can handle higher-order functions, lazy evaluation, recursion, and parallelism. You can learn more about functional programming in Python from [this article].
- Decorators: These are special functions that modify or enhance other functions or classes without changing their original code. They allow you to add functionality or behavior to existing code in a flexible and expressive way. You can learn more about decorators in Python from [this guide].
- Generators: These are special functions that produce a sequence of values lazily, meaning they only compute the next value when requested. They allow you to create efficient and memory-friendly iterators that can handle infinite or large data streams. You can learn more about generators in Python from [this tutorial].

- Asyncio: This is a module that provides a framework for writing asynchronous code that can execute multiple tasks concurrently without blocking the main thread. It allows you to create high-performance and scalable applications that can handle network IO, concurrency, parallelism, and coroutines. You can learn more about asyncio in Python from [this article].

## Learn git

- Git is a version control system that helps you track changes and collaborate on code projects.
- It allows you to create branches, merge conflicts, revert mistakes, push and pull changes, and more.
- Learning git will help you manage your code effectively and work with other developers efficiently.
- You can learn git from [this book], [this tutorial], or [this interactive course].
- Some of the benefits of learning git are:
- You can keep track of your code history and see what changes were made by whom and when.
- You can undo or redo any changes easily without losing your work or breaking your code.
- You can work on different features or bug fixes without affecting the main code base by creating separate branches.
- You can resolve any conflicts or errors that may arise when merging different branches by using git tools or commands.
- You can share your code with other developers or users by pushing it to remote repositories such as GitHub or Bitbucket.

- You can access your code from anywhere by cloning it from remote repositories or pulling it from local repositories.

## Contribute to open source projects

- Open source projects are software projects that have their source code publicly available and allow anyone to contribute to them.
- Contributing to open source projects will help you improve your coding skills, learn from other developers, build your portfolio, and make an impact on the software community.
- You can find open source projects that use Python on GitHub, PyPI, or Awesome Python.
- You can also check out [this guide] on how to contribute to open source projects.
- Some of the steps involved in contributing to open source projects are:
- Find a project that interests you and matches your skill level and domain.
- Fork the project to your own account and clone it to your local machine.
- Create a new branch for your feature or bug fix and make your changes.
- Test your changes and make sure they follow the projectâ€™s coding style and guidelines.
- Commit your changes and push them to your forked repository.
- Create a pull request to the original project and describe your changes and why they are useful or necessary.

- Wait for feedback or approval from the project maintainers and address any issues or suggestions they may have.

- Celebrate your contribution and thank the project maintainers and other contributors for their support and collaboration.

## Know the field you would love to specialize

- Python is a general-purpose language that can be used for various domains and applications.

- Depending on your interests and goals, you may want to specialize in a specific field that uses Python extensively.

- Some of the fields that you can choose from are:
      
        - Machine learning: This is the field of computer 
        science that deals with creating systems that can learn 
        from data and perform tasks such as classification, 
        regression, clustering, recommendation, natural 
        language processing, computer vision, etc. You can 
        learn machine learning with Python from the book 
        Hands_On_Machine_Learning_with_Scikit_Learn,_Keras,_and_Tensorflow

        - Artificial intelligence: This is the field of 
        computer science that deals with creating systems that 
        can exhibit human-like intelligence and behavior such 
        as reasoning, planning, problem-solving, creativity, 
        etc.
  
        - Data science: This is the field of science that deals 
        with collecting, analyzing, visualizing, and 
        communicating data to gain insights and make decisions. 
        You can learn data science with Python from the book 
        Python for Data Analysis_ Data Wrangling with Pandas, Numpy, and Ipython
        
        - Back end development: This is the field of web 
        development that deals with creating the server-side 
        logic and functionality of web applications such as 
        databases, APIs, authentication, security, etc.
  
        - Other fields: There are many other fields that you 
        can specialize in with Python such as game development, 
        desktop GUI, scientific computing, web scraping, 
        automation, etc. You can find more resources and 
        projects for these fields on Awesome Python.

  ## Work on more open source projects on the field you specialized
  
  - After you have chosen a field that you want to specialize in, you can work on more open source projects that are related to that field.
  
  - This will help you deepen your knowledge, sharpen your skills, expand your network, and showcase your expertise.
  
  - You can find more open source projects on GitHub, PyPI, or Awesome Python.
  
  - You can also create your own open source projects and share them with the world.
